/**
 * Translation for plugin UI (`gloomberb/i18n`).
 *
 * A plugin pane sits next to built-in ones, so its labels have to follow the
 * language the user picked or the pane reads half-translated. `t` looks a
 * string up in the app's own tables and falls back to the English source, and
 * `useAppLanguage` re-renders a pane when the preference changes.
 *
 * It is a shared host module: the tables and the current language live in host
 * state, and a bundled copy would answer in English forever.
 *
 * Compatibility commitment: see the note in `./utils.ts`.
